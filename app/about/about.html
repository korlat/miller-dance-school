                    Miss Katie began dancing at the tender age of two and hasnâ€™t put away her dancing shoes since.
                    Although she always enjoyed performing and being in front of the curtain, her passion and true
                    talent is in teaching and choreography. Miss Katie has worked as lead choreographer for many schools
                    and production companies and often guest choreographs on various projects. Miss Katie started her
                    training with Vanda Morgan completing her ISTD and RAD exams at the age of 18 before flying the
                    nest to study law and child psychology at the University of Warwick.

                    Although fully equipped for a career in the big city, she knew her true passion was dancing and that
                    nothing else could compete! She went on to train professionally at the Masters Performing Arts
                    College and more recently with the Royal Academy of Dance.

                    shows, festivals and competitions, as well as entering children into exams with a 100% pass rate.
