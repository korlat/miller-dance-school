                <p>Miss Katie began dancing at the tender age of two and hasnâ€™t put her dancing shoes down since.
                    Although she has enjoyed performing and being in front of the curtain, her passion and true talent
                    is in
                    teaching and choreographing.
                <p>Miss Katie started her training with Vanda Morgan, with whom she stayed until the age of 18 before
                    flying
                    the nest to study law and child psychology at the University of Warwick.
                    Although fully equipped for a career in the big city, she knew her true passion was dancing and that
                    nothing
                    else could compete!
                    She went on to train professionally at the Masters Performing Arts College and gain her teaching
                    qualifications with the ISTD and IDTA.</p>
                <p>Miss Katie has since taught many many children and students, choreographed for numerous successful
                    shows,
                    festivals and competitions, as well as entering children into exams with a 100% pass rate with the
                    ISTD and
