                    Miss Katie began dancing at the tender age of two and hasnâ€™t put away her dancing shoes since.
                    Although she always enjoyed performing and being in front of the curtain, her passion and true
                    talent is in teaching and choreography. Miss Katie started her training with Vanda Morgan completing
                    her ISTD and RAD exams until the age of 18 before flying the nest to study law and child psychology
                    at the University of Warwick.

                    She then went on to train professionally at the Masters Performing Arts College and more recently
                    with the Royal Academy of Dance. Miss Katie took over the Miller School of Dance only last April
                    2016 and made it her top priority to ensure the usual bi-annual show went ahead. It has been very
                    full on but most of all it has been wonderful working with such a beautiful school full of talented
                    students. Miss Katie has three children, one already apart of the school, and a very supportive
                    husband, all of whom have been a huge support during this opportunity.

                    She would like to thank all of the children and parents of the school who have been so supportive
                    during this change and a very huge thank you to Auntie Sheila, who holds the school together and
                    works incredibly hard. Thank you to my wonderful teachers for their hard work and a very special
                    thank you to Miss Suzie, a friend and colleague who has been a huge support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miss Katie would like to wish all the children and students lots of luck and remind them the most
                    important thing is to smile and enjoy!
